<h1>Make a Move</h1>

A job and apartment searching website for people who want to relocate.

<hr>
http://make-a-move.herokuapp.com/

This website allows users to search for jobs and apartments at the same time by pulling information using the indeed API and the Yelp API. The search results then populate a list and corresponding markers drop on the map using the AngularJS Google Maps V3 Directives. The user can click on an apartment and view more information such as the image, rating, and user reviews provided by Yelp, and the walk score provided by the Walk Score API. The user can then view the blue and red markers on the map, indicating jobs and apartments, and drag marker A and B to get a new set of directions.
